This is an AI-based driver safety risk prediction system built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and Stripe. The project includes live driver risk detection, analytics dashboards, accident prediction, model upload, and user authentication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* PostgreSQL database (local or hosted)
* Environment variables configured (see below)

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the project root with the following keys:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

(Any values may be mocked during development; the app includes guards for missing variables.)

### Development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build for production

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
